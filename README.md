# Project Skyhook v.0.67

Stay Tuned, it's only getting better! We'll have an update on our custom tablet launcher app soon. In the mean time, uninstall your current Full Screen 3.4 add-on by navigating to about:addons on your tablet browser then visit skyhook.sh to install the updated version (reboot required after install for context menu options to update correctly)

Project Skyhook, The Open-Source Bitcoin ATM. By Open-Source we mean free as-in freedom and by Bitcoin ATM we mean Cash in, BTC out. We think of Skyhook as a vending machine. However, to avoid confusion we've started calling it a Bitcoin ATM.
